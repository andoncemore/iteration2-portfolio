			<h2>The Mechanics of Kan Jam</h2>
			<h3>Spring 2013 | 2 Person Team</h3>
			<div class='description'>
				<hr>
				<h4>Quick Read</h4>
				<p>For this project, I worked with another person to analyze the game of Kan-Jam to determine whether the scoring is representative of the difficulty of each shot in the game. To do this, we characterized the system and then used this information to simulate the system in MATLAB. Using the results of the simulation, we wrote a paper that concluded that the scoring system of Kan-Jam was in fact not representative of the difficulty and suggested a change in the scoring.</p>

			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>This project was done for the Mechanics class at Olin College. For the project, we had to choose a system, make an argument on the system, and then write an acedemic paper on any conclusions made. We decided to choose the system of Kan Jam, a game where you try to throw a frisbee into a can and collect points. THe final deliverable for this project was the final paper.</p>
			<h4>Simulating the System</h4>
			<p>To simulate the system in MATALAB </p>
			<h4>Writing a Paper</h4>
			<h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
