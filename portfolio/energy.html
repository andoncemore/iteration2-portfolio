					<h1>Background</h1>
					<p>I worked on research with one other person on building and modeling an energy harvester, that takes advantage of vibration. This was a research project that was worked on for multiple years. I worked on redesigning specific parts of the test rig and improving the mathematical model we had for the system.</p>

					<h1>Mechanical Design</h1>
					<p>The mechanical design aspect of this project was redesigning parts of the test rig to improve the quality of the experimental tests we were doing. The main part that I redesigned was the torsional setup. The airfoil is mounted on a torsional rod in a windtunnel. One of the variables we wanted to be able to control is the moment of inertia of the airfoil. To do this, I designed and built weights to mount to the airfoil to vary the moment of inertia. Using Solidworks, I was able to design various weights that could be combined to achieve a varying range of moments for the airfoil. The weights were cut out of steel plate on a waterjet, and mounting blocks were made on a manual mill. </p>

					<h1>Mechanical Analysis</h1>
					<p>The other part of this project was mechanical analysis. We had to match the physical results to a model we made in MATLAB. To do this, we needed to take physical measurements from the test rig and calculate constants. These constants were then put into the MATLAB model. We took many experiments, like the one below, and were able to extract enough information to fully characterize the system mathematically. </p>
