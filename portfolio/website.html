					<h1>Background</h1>
					<p>During the summer of 2013, I decided to build my own website. I originally planned on using Bootstrap to make the website, but I wanted more control over my design. I ended up building the entire website from scratch. To do this, I taught myself HTML and CSS, and then built the entire website from the ground up.</p>

				<div class="section">
					<h1>Design Choices</h1>
					<p>The biggest design choice I had was how to layout the portfolio homepage. To make this decision, I did some whiteboard sketches. Using other sites I had seen, and some unique ideas, I put about 10 ideas on the board. Figure 1, below, shows one of the ideas. I narrowed down my choices by which ones would be the easiest to navigate and I could feasibly build. I eventually settled on the simple thumbnail design that I currently use on the site.</p>

					<p>My first iteration of the website was a fixed width website. While I really liked the design of the webpage, I didn't like how the website didn't really respond to how the reader used their browser. This lead to me making the entire page responsive, using media queries. I experimented using more hover capability. </p>

					<h1>Writing Code</h1>
					<p>As I stated earlier, before starting this project, I had no idea how to build a website. I taught myself basic html and css. I built on this basic knowledge by playing around with Bootstrap. By experimenting with Bootstrap's source code, I learned a lot about responsive design. It also introduced me to LESS, and css preprocessing. I applied all this knowledge in my website. The entire process was very iterative and I designed entirely in the browser. I would write some code, see how it looked, and then make changes until I thought it was perfect. </p>
