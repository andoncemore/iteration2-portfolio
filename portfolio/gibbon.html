					<h1>Background</h1>
					<p>For this project, I worked in a team of five to build a bio-inspired toy for fourth graders. Through the course of the project, I went through the design process, starting from learning about the user group to iterating through mechanical prototypes. I learned a lot about project scheduling and working on a large team.</p>

				<div class="section">
					<h1>Design Process</h1>
					<p>We began the design process for this project by coming up with different types of motion we could have our toy do and different types of games fourth graders could play. We put all these ideas on sticky notes and put them on posters. We then attempted to mix and match different games with different motion styles. This gave us five concepts, which we then elaborated on. Eventually, we settled on the jungle river game, with a swinging motion.</p>

					<h1>Bio-Inspired Design</h1>
					<p>One of the main goals of this project was to design our toy after the motion of a real animal. Our toy was based on the motion of a gibbon. In order to design a mechanical system, we needed to completely understand and visualize the swinging motion of the gibbon, and condense its complex motion into something we could build into a toy. We managed to simplify the swinging motion into two specific movements, which helped us get a start on mechanical design.</p>

					<h1>Mechanical Design</h1>
					<p>Mechanically, there were many small subsystems that needed to work together for our gibbon to swing across monkey bars. I was given the responsibility of designing the legs, which were an integral part of the game. The legs I ended up designing were laser cut out of delrin. The lower leg is always vertical, and the upper legs are attached to a servo, which allows the user to pick up items from the ground with a magnet, as the gibbon swings along the monkey bars.</p>

					<p>We did a lot of sketch modeling to get a sense of scale as well as to understand how our gibbon toy was going to work. Below is an example of one simple model we made to explore how to gear the arms so they would move in the opposite direction when actuated. We also made simple sketch models of the arm subsystem and the body before we began to design parts.</p>
